This has also resulted in an increase of security threats and difficulties in detecting network intrusions.Intruders with malicious intents pose a major danger to the network's confidentiality, integrity, and availability. In order to decrease these risks, network traffic is monitored and any intrusions are stopped using a network intrusion detection system (NIDS). Machine learning (ML) is being used to detect network attacks through the usage of ML-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS).These systems' main objective is to offer effective network-wide detection.The expansion of connected devices and network intrusion detection systems faces challenges at every stage of development and operation as attacker tactics and methods constantly change. As a result, ML methods are increasingly used in NIDS.")
